# Granular vs Colloidal 
granular systems made up of macroscopic particles possess similarities with colloidal ones. The crucial difference, however, is that thermal fluctuations are negligible for such materials. Hence granular systems are intrinsically athermal. Nonetheless, shaking granulates lying on vibrating substrates is a common practice to study two dimensional phase transitions

# Stiffness 
1) [Joe Swift and Dennis E. Discher] The nuclear lamina is mechano-responsive to ECM elasticity in mature tissue. Journal of Cell Science, 2014 [LaminaECM2014.pdf]

![micro-stiffness](https://github.com/ankitbioinfo/interestingLinks/blob/master/micro-stiffness.png)

Left: the quantity of type I collagen present in tissues is proportional to tissue micro-elasticity (Swift et al., 2013b). As collagen is one of the most prevalent proteins in the body, it is, perhaps, expected that it defines mechanical properties. Right: the ratio of A-type lamin to B-type lamin in the nuclear lamina is proportional to tissue microelasticity. The lamina contains predominantly A-type lamins in stiff tissue, whereas B-type lamins are prevalent in the nuclear lamina in soft tissue (Swift et al., 2013b).

![Embryo stiffness](https://github.com/ankitbioinfo/interestingLinks/blob/master/stiffnessInEmbryo.png)

Left: observations made in adult tissue are consistent with results from the developing chick; the embryonic disc was initially soft, but divergent tissues either remained soft (e.g. brain, blue) or became increasingly stiff (e.g. heart, red). Inset: developing chick hearts were probed by micropipette aspiration to determine micro-elasticity. Middle: tissue stiffening during development is accompanied by increased levels of collagen and A-type lamins (Lehner et al., 1987; Majkut et al., 2013). Right: embryonic stem cells initially express negligible quantities of A-type lamin proteins, but these levels increase as the nucleus stiffens during lineage commitment (Pajerowski et al., 2007).
