# Granular vs Colloidal 
granular systems made up of macroscopic particles possess similarities with colloidal ones. The crucial difference, however, is that thermal fluctuations are negligible for such materials. Hence granular systems are intrinsically athermal. Nonetheless, shaking granulates lying on vibrating substrates is a common practice to study two dimensional phase transitions
